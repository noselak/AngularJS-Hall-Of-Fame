# AngulaRank Challenge #
### Hello friends! ###
Thank you for an interesting challenge. This is a sample of a product which you requested. I've applied most of the required features. Due to the time limit the repository details module hasn't been added.
### Libraries I've used: ###
* AngularJS 1.5.8 - core of my app which is responsible for the structure, requesting and processing data, generating views;
* jQuery 1.12.4 - used for triggering css animations. This could be done via Angular alone but I've used jQuery for demonstration purposes (and because it's a great library);
* _underscore - minor help in data processing;
* Bootstrap 3.3.7 - responsible for RWD;
### Conclusion ###
Please provide constructive feedback after code review.
Some of the functions I planned to add (list pagination, search/filter input fields, asc/desc sort function triggered by click on the column name, list subpage and loadpage animations) haven't been added due to time limit. Thank you!
